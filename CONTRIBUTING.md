Well, there's no much to say... if you wanna to contribute, just do it!

You are welcome to help by giving suggestions, making changes, or anything else.

But try to respect the original idea of the project. Like keeping it open and free.

Use tab identation if possible and comment the code everytime you think it's necessary.

Also, feel free to fix any errors I made in the code. Nobody is perfect.
And it's it.
