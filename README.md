> A tool to create/update GitHub repositories from command line.


This is a tool for linux command line enthusiasts.  Simple and unofficial,
it allows you to create and/or update GitHub repositories directly from the
command line (which is much faster than opening the browser every time).

To use it, you need to configure your local GitHub with your username and your
application token.

    Example: 'git config --global github.user <username>'
             'git config --global github.token <token>'

If you don't have a token, you can generate one in GitHub `Settings` > `Applications`.
